# 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the inhibitory activity of compounds against **Acetylcholinesterase (AChE)**.

Acetylcholinesterase is a crucial enzyme responsible for breaking down the neurotransmitter acetylcholine. Inhibiting this enzyme is an important therapeutic strategy in diseases such as:

- Alzheimer's Disease
- Dementia
- Myasthenia Gravis
- Glaucoma

Using molecular descriptors derived from chemical structures, the QSAR model estimates biological activity without requiring laboratory experiments.
